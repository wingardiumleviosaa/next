How long before I get in,  
before it starts  
before I begin  
還要多久 我才能到達呢  
還要多久 這一切才開始呢  
還要多久 我才能開始呢  

How long before you decide  
before I know what it feels like  
還要多久 你才能決定呢  
還要多久 我才能知道這什麼感覺呢  

Where to  
where do I go?  
if you never try   
then you'll never know  
哪裡呢  
我該去哪裡呢  
但你若不嘗試 就永遠不會知道  

How long do I have to climb  
up on the side of this mountain of mine  
我還需要爬多久才能爬上自己人生的巔峰  

Look up  
I look up at night  
planets are moving at the speed of light  
往上看  
我在夜裡仰望星空  
星星們在光速飛行  

Climb up  
up in the trees  
every chance that you get   
is a chance you seize  
向上爬  
往樹上爬  
你得到的每個機會都是你可以抓住的!  


How long am I gonna stand  
with my head stuck under the sand？  
I'll start before I couldn't stop  
or before I see things in the right way up  
我還要忍受逃避現實多久  
我會在我無法忍受前開始  
或在我以正確的方式看清事物前開始  

All that noise and all that sound  
all those places I got found  
and birds go flying at the speed of sound  
to show you how it all began  
突然我意識到所有那些噪音、聲音、地方  
以及剎那飛過的群鳥  
都只爲啓示  
一切如此開端  

birds came flying from the underground  
if you could see it then you'll understand  
群鳥從地下飛起  
當你看見這一幕時你也會醒悟  

ideas that you'll never find  
all the inventors could never design  
the buildings that you put up  
Japan and China all lit up  
有些道理永遠想不通  
有些設計發明家也做不到  
而你的創造  
把中國和日本都照亮  

the sign that I couldn't read  
or a light that I couldn't see  
some things you have to believe  
but others are puzzles  
are puzzles of me  
有些跡象我無法解讀  
或我無法看見的光芒  
有些東西你必須相信  
但其他謎題就只是謎題  

all that noise and all that sound  
all those places I got found  
and birds go flying at the speed of sound  
to show you how it all began  
突然我意識到所有那些噪音、聲音、地方

birds came flying from the underground  
if you could see it then you'll understand  
oh, when you see it then you'll understand  
當鳥群從地下飛出  
你看見就懂了  
你看見就懂了  

all those signs I knew what they meant  
some things you can't invent  
some get made  
some get sent  
我明白了所有的跡象  
有些東西你無法發明  
一些就是這麼做出來的  
另一些是被外星人送來的 XD  

and birds go flying at the speed of sound  
to show you how it all began  
birds came flying from the underground  
If you could see it then you'll understand  
Oh, when you see it then you'll understand  
鳥剎那間飛過  
都只爲啓示  
一切如此開端  
當鳥群從地下飛出  
你一看見就懂了  
我想 當你看見時你也會懂的~
