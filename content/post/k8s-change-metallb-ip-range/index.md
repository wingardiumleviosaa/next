## why we need to delete all metallb pod

MetalLB rejects new configurations if the new configuration would break existing services. Your new configuration does not allow existing services to continue existing, so MetalLB ignored it. There are log entries in the controller and speaker pods about this.

To force MetalLB to accept an unsafe configuration, delete all the controller and speaker pods. When they restart, they'll accept the new configuration and change all your services.Â 

`kubectl delete po -n metallb-system --all`
